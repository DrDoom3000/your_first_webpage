---HTML tutorial---
___What is HTML?
HTML (Hypertext markup language) is a language dedicated to creating Hypertext files. Hypertext is a form of text where a document isn't read straight, it has links (so called Hyperlinks) to other documents and/or points in the document.
___How to code in HTML?
Each tag in HTML begins with < and ends with >. A tag is before and after something it shall show, such as the paragraph-tag:
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
The last tag always has a / after the < to show it's a so-called closing tag.
The syntax is quite easy:
<tag>Parent					|Adds a Parent object
	<tag>Child</tag>			|Child of the Parent object
	<tag>Another Child</tag>		|Child of the Parent object too
</tag>						|Closes the Parent object
An HTML document starts with <html> and ends with </html>. It has 2 parts:
<head>
	|Here, tab title etc. are defined
</head>
<body>
	|Here, everything showed in the webpage is defined
</body>
To create the tab title, use
<title>Title</title>
For headings, use
<h1>Big heading</h1>
up to
<h6>Small header</h6>
to create a paragraph, use the
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
tag. To make handling of many headings and paragraphs easier, use 
<article></article>
Embed a link with
<a href="https://example.website.domain">Name it is referred to on the site</a>
And use images with
<img src="image.png"/>
This is a so-called self-closing tag. It is fully self-contained and is only 1 tag, not 2 tags.
To reference a CSS-file, use
<link rel="Name in this script" href="Script.css"/>
This is fully self-contained too.
